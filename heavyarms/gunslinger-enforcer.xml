			<p>Even in bad company, enforcers have a reputation for giving as good as they get, shrugging off blow after blow and returning tenfold.  Yet it is not only their tenacity that makes them a valuable ally but also their keen insight; a knack for sniffing out the truth that is as dangerous to an adversary as any arms they can bring to bear.</p>
