			<p><i>3rd Level Preacher Class Feature</i></p>
			<p>Through the ardency of your faith, you can heal others at a cost to yourself.  When you use your Buck Up, you can choose another creature within 60 feet of you that you can see to regain hit points instead of you.  For each Hit Die spent, roll the die and add your Wisdom modifier to it.  The target regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1 hit point).  This feature has no effect on constructs or undead.</p>

This ability can't restore to life a creature that has died of old age or is a construct or an undead, nor can it restore any missing body parts.  A creature can be returned to life in this way no more than once between long rests.</p>
