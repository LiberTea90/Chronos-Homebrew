		<description>
			<p>An old saloon, scored with bullets and stained with blood, stands before a lone gunslinger.  "I've come for you!" she yells, the sound cutting through the revelry within.  In the silence, she waits, the wind grasping at her scarf and spitting dust across her path.  A large man pushes through the doors.  "Heh," he sneers, fingering a gun at his hip.  "And what's a little-" he begins, moving to draw, but she is faster, her fists full of roaring thunder.</p>
			<p class="indent">A mercenary gauges his final opponent through a haze of smoke.  She returns his appraising stare from over her cards.  She waits, biting on her cigar before throwing in a stack of chips, but her nervous chewing betrays the bluff.  The man returns her smile, "All in."</p>
			<p class="indent">In a hostelry basement, an old man heaves himself from a copper bathtub, steam clinging to his scarred body.  "Evil comes," he whispers in a cracked voice.  The exclamations of his bathing companions are cut short by the sound of heavy, dragging footfalls overhead.  The man mutters a brief prayer as he recovers his gun belt from a loose pile of clothes.</p>
			<p class="indent">With an aim as sharp as their wit, gunslingers pursue their own ends for their own reasons, beholden to no code except their own, and trusting no judgment save that learned through experience.  The wild frontier breeds hard folks to hard ways, a dangerous land where life can hinge on a deal of the cards or the speed of the draw.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A GUNSLINGER</h4>
			<p>When building a gunslinger consider how you came to live by the gun.  Was it for justice?  Fame?  To protect someone or something you hold dear?  And what drew you now?  The reassuring clink of coin in your pocket?  The righteous satisfaction of vanquishing evil?  Maybe past transgressions weigh heavy on your heart, driving you to find redemption?  Or do you seek revenge?  Who is the character behind the gun?</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a gunslinger quickly by following these suggestions.  First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom.  Second, choose the criminal or folk hero background.</p>

			<h5>Special Ammunition</h5>
			<p><b>Heat Seeker.</b> When you attack a creature that isn’t a Construct or an Undead using this ammunition, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll, and the target gains no benefit from cover for the attack.</p>
			<p><b>Incendiary.</b> Attacks using this ammunition that hit deal fire damage instead of the weapon’s normal damage type, cause the target to start burning (1d6), and ignite flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.</p>

		<description>
			<p> A burning creature takes fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The amount of damage is shown in the triggering effect in parentheses.</p>
			<p>The creature sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.</p>
			<p> If a creature is subjected to burning from multiple sources, only the highest source of damage applies; they aren’t added together. For example, a creature subjected to burning (1d6) and burning (2d6) takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns.</p>
			<p> The condition ends if the creature or another creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or some other effect douses it, such as being doused with water.</p>
