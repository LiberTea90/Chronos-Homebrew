			<p><b>Lightning:</b> This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a (DC 15) Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.  The Javelin then teleports back to your hand.</p>

			<p>If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>
			<p><b>Defect:</b></p>
			<p><b>Blood Lust:</b> After entering your Blood Rage make a Wisdom Saving throw (DC 15).  On a failure you lose the ability to distinguish between friend and foe.
