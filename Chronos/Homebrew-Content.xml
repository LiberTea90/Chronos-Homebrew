			<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Clock Strike</b> When you hit a creature with this weapon you can expend one charge and force them to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15).  On a failure the creature suffers the effects of a "Slow" spell (using your concentration).  A creature affected by the "Slow" spell in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn.  You may dismiss the effect as a Bonus Action on your turn.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Defect:</b></p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Gear Jam</b> If the creature succeeds on their saving throw against your Clock Strike, the effect backfires.  Make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15).  On a failure you suffer the effects of a "Slow" spell (using your concentration).  You may repeat the saving throw at the end of your next turn or dismiss the effect as a Bonus Action on your next turn.</p>
